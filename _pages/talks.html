Modeling, Simulation and Visual Analysis of Crowds A Multidisciplinary Perspective
Series: The International Series in Video Computing, Vol. 11

This book grew out of the 1st IEEE Workshop on Modeling, Simulation and Visual Analysis of Large Crowds, that was held in conjunction with International Conference of Computer Vision 2011.

The book discusses common challenges and points to problem areas related to modeling, simulation, and visual analysis of crowds facilitates the process of cross-disciplinary interaction among researchers from areas of computer vision, computer graphics and evacuation dynamics by providing a common platform provides a comprehensive map of the current state of the art in these distinct but related fields

Over the last several years there has been a growing interest in developing computational methodologies for modeling and analyzing movements and behaviors of ‘crowds' of people. This interest spans several scientific areas that includes Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Pedestrian Evacuation Dynamics. Despite the fact that these different scientific fields are trying to model the same physical entity (i.e. a crowd of people), research ideas have evolved independently. As a result each discipline has developed techniques and perspectives that are characteristically their own.

The goal of this book to provide the readers a comprehensive map towards the common goal of better analyzing and synthesizing the pedestrian movement in dense, heterogeneous crowds. The monograph is organized into different parts that consolidate various aspects of research towards this common goal, namely the modeling, simulation, and visual analysis of crowds.

Through this book, readers will see the common ideas and vision as well as the different challenges and techniques, that will stimulate novel approaches to fully grasping “crowds."
