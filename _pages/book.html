  <br>
  This book grew out of the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6130194">1st IEEE Workshop on Modeling, Simulation and Visual Analysis of Large Crowds</a>, which was held in conjunction with the International Conference on Computer Vision 2011.
  <br>

  <br>
  There has been a growing interest in developing computational methodologies for modeling and analyzing the movements and behaviors of crowds of people.
  This interest spans several scientific areas, including Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Pedestrian Evacuation Dynamics. Despite the fact that these
  different scientific fields are trying to model the same physical entity (i.e. a crowd of people), research ideas
  have evolved independently. As a result each discipline has developed techniques and perspectives that are characteristically their own

  <br>
  The goal of this book is to facilitate cross-disciplinary interaction among researchers in these fields by providing a common platform
  where ideas about analyzing and synthesizing pedestrian movement in dense, heterogeneous crowds can be discussed.
